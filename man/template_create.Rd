Create a template to fill the CRediT author statement.
(\url{https://credit.niso.org}). The template is a table where the authors
are the rows and the columns are the roles.
}
\details{
The dataframe can be edited in R or, if file is provided, it is
exported to a csv to be edited manually in your preferred csv editor. The
csv is created to be compatible with Microsoft Excel, since it is the most
popular spreadsheet software among scientists. Therefore, it is separated
by semicolon.
