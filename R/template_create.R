#' Create a template to fill the CRediT author statement.
#' @description Create a template to fill the CRediT author statement.
#' (\url{https://credit.niso.org}). The template is a table where the authors
#' are the rows and the columns are the roles.
#' @param authors A character vector with all the authors to be included in the
#' statement.
#' @param file If a path is provided, the template is saved as a csv for excel
#' @param roles A character vector with the roles to be included in the
#' statement. If NULL, it uses all the roles defined in the CRediT author
#' statement.
#' @returns A dataframe with a row for each author and a column for each role,
#' filled with zeros.
#' @details The dataframe can be edited in R or, if file is provided, it is
#' exported to a csv to be edited manually in your preferred csv editor. The
#' csv is created to be compatible with Microsoft Excel, since it is the most
#' popular spreadsheet software among scientists. Therefore, it is separated
#' by semicolon.
#' @examples
#' template_create(authors = c("Josep Maria", "Jane Doe"))
#' @export
